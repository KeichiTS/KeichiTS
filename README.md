# Eeai, Beleza? 

My name is Victor Keichi Tsutsumiuchi. I have a degree in Physics and Meteorology, both from the [University of São Paulo (USP)](https://www5.usp.br/), and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Nuclear Physics at [Nuclear and Energy Research Institute (IPEN-USP)](https://www.ipen.br).

Currently, I am developing technologies for simulating the dispersion of radionuclides from mines, waste deposits, or accidents.

My interests and skills include natural sciences, programming, eletronics, and app and video game development.
